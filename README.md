About PEEL APPEAL (A Banana Bonanza!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peel Appeal is a vibrant and energetic banana-selling company dedicated to providing the freshest and most delicious bananas to their customers. 

As their business continues to grow, they recognize the need to have a professional web presence that will not only showcase their delightful products but also streamline their operations and enhance their customer experience.

Consequently, they are looking for a straightforward yet effective web application that should be built using:
<ul>
	<li>HTML,</li>
	<li>CSS,</li>
	<li>JavaScript,</li>
	<li>and Vanilla (Plain) PHP,</li>
</ul>

This will ensure that it remains lightweight, easy to maintain, and accessible.

Here are the key features they would like the web application to have:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Product Listing: A section to display the different types of bananas they sell.
2. Delivery Destinations: A page that lists the various delivery destinations they serve
	- This should include an option to add extra delivery destinations.
3. Company Description: A dedicated page describing Peel Appeal, their mission, values, and what sets them apart from other banana sellers.
4. Contact Details: An easy-to-find section that provides their contact details.
5. Clientele Distribution: A page that will show the number of our dedicated clients per delivery destination.
6. Logo: Additionally, they would also like you to design a logo for their company.
7. Theme: They have requested that the color theme on the website should match or be close to the actual banana color.
8. Feel free to be more creative with other parts of the website
9. For now the website must not have the sign-up and sign-in implementation (this will be in version 2)
	- Note that for your class project you MUST implememnt these features
